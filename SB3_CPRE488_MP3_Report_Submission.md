## `launcher_fire.c` Makefile

This Makefile is configured to build both a Linux kernel module (`launcher_driver.ko`) and a user-space program (`launcher_fire`) using a cross-compiler for ARM architecture. 

### Cross-Compilation Setup

The Makefile uses the `CROSS_COMPILE` environment variable to specify the cross-compiler toolchain:

```makefile
CC := $(CROSS_COMPILE)gcc
```

This is the core mechanism that enables ARM architecture targeting. The `CROSS_COMPILE` variable is expected to be set in the environment before running the make command (e.g., `CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf-` or similar ARM toolchain prefix). When expanded, it creates commands like `arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc` that invoke the cross-compiler instead of the host system's native compiler.

### Kernel Module Building

For the kernel module (`launcher_driver.ko`):

1. `obj-m += launcher_driver.o` tells the kernel build system which object files to build into modules.
2. `KDIR := ../linux/linux-xlnx/` points to the Xilinx Linux kernel source directory (often used for Zynq ARM platforms).
3. The main kernel build is triggered with:

   ```makefile
   $(MAKE) -C $(KDIR) M=${shell pwd} modules
   ```

   This invokes the kernel's build system, which will use the cross-compiler settings defined in the kernel's configuration.

### User-Space Program Building

For the user application (`launcher_fire`):

1. The application is built directly using the cross-compiler via:

   ```makefile
   $(BIN): $(SOURCES)
       $(CC) $@.c -o $@
   ```

   The `$(CC)` variable expands to the cross-compiler as defined earlier.

### Clean Target

The clean target is thorough, removing both the kernel module files and the user-space binary:

```makefile
clean:
  -$(MAKE) -C $(KDIR) M=${shell pwd} clean || true
  -rm $(BIN) || true
  -rm *.o *.ko *.mod.{c,o} modules.order Module.symvers || true
```

The `launcher_fire.c` code is a user-space application that communicates with the kernel module through a device node (`/dev/launcher0`), sending commands to control what seems to be a physical launcher device (likely a USB missile launcher or similar gadget).

This configuration works for ARM because:

1. It uses the ARM cross-compiler toolchain via `CROSS_COMPILE`
2. It builds against an ARM-targeted kernel source tree (Xilinx's Linux kernel)
3. The resulting binaries will be compatible with ARM systems, specifically a Xilinx Zynq platform.

## Boot Process Analysis

### U-Boot Initialization (Bootloader Phase)

```bash
U-Boot 2020.01 (Mar 14 2025 - 15:19:07 +0000)

CPU:   Zynq 7z020
Silicon: v3.1
Model: Zynq Zed Development Board
DRAM:  ECC disabled 512 MiB
Flash: 0 Bytes
NAND:  0 MiB
MMC:   mmc@e0100000: 0
```

This section shows U-Boot 2020.01 bootloader starting. It identifies the hardware as a Zynq 7z020 CPU on a Zed Development Board with 512MB of RAM (with ECC disabled). It's detecting storage devices, including an MMC (SD card) interface.

```bash
Loading Environment from SPI Flash... SF: Detected s25fl256s1 with page size 256 Bytes, erase size 64 KiB, total 32 MiB
*** Warning - bad CRC, using default environment
```

U-Boot is attempting to load environment variables from SPI Flash memory. It finds an s25fl256s1 flash chip (32MB total) but encounters a CRC error, so it falls back to default settings.

```bash
In:    serial@e0001000
Out:   serial@e0001000
Err:   serial@e0001000
Net:   
ZYNQ GEM: e000b000, mdio bus e000b000, phyaddr 0, interface rgmii-id
```

Sets up the console I/O through a serial port (UART) and initializes the Gigabit Ethernet MAC (GEM).

### Boot Image Loading

```bash
Hit any key to stop autoboot:  2  1  0 
switch to partitions #0, OK
mmc0 is current device
Scanning mmc 0:1...
Found U-Boot script /boot.scr
2010 bytes read in 33 ms (58.6 KiB/s)
## Executing script at 03000000
11543076 bytes read in 656 ms (16.8 MiB/s)
```

U-Boot is performing autoboot countdown.

After no interruption, it scans the first partition of the SD card, finds a boot script, and executes it.

This script then loads the kernel and initial ramdisk.

```bash
## Loading kernel from FIT Image at 10000000 ...
   Using 'conf@system-top.dtb' configuration
   Verifying Hash Integrity ... OK
   Trying 'kernel@1' kernel subimage

   Verifying Hash Integrity ... sha256+ OK
```

U-Boot is loading the Linux kernel from a FIT (Flattened Image Tree) image.

It verifies the hash integrity of the kernel (4.1 MiB in size) to ensure it hasn't been corrupted.

```bash
## Loading ramdisk from FIT Image at 10000000 ...
   [Details about the ramdisk loading]
## Loading fdt from FIT Image at 10000000 ...
   [Details about the device tree loading]
```

Next, it loads the initial RAM disk (6.9 MiB) and the Flattened Device Tree (FDT) file that describes the hardware to the kernel.

### Linux Kernel Startup

```bash

## Kernel Messages For USB Device

> Note: This is prior to setup of the kernel object device driver.

```bash
avnet-digilent-zedboard-2020_1:~$ usb 1-1: new low-speed USB device number 2 using ci_hdrc
usb 1-1: New USB device found, idVendor=2123, idProduct=1010, bcdDevice= 0.01
usb 1-1: New USB device strings: Mfr=1, Product=2, SerialNumber=0
usb 1-1: Product: USB Missile Launcher
usb 1-1: Manufacturer: Syntek
hid-generic 0003:2123:1010.0001: device has no listeners, quitting
```

1. `usb 1-1: new low-speed USB device number 2 using ci_hdrc` - This indicates a new USB device connecting at the low-speed USB specification (1.5 Mbps) and is being assigned device number 2. The "ci_hdrc" refers to the USB host controller driver.
2. `usb 1-1: New USB device found, idVendor=2123, idProduct=1010, bcdDevice= 0.01` - The system has identified the USB device with its vendor ID (2123) and product ID (1010). These unique identifiers tell the system what device is connected. The bcdDevice value (0.01) indicates the device's firmware/version number.
3. `usb 1-1: New USB device strings: Mfr=1, Product=2, SerialNumber=0` - This shows that the device provides manufacturer and product string descriptors but no serial number.
4. `usb 1-1: Product: USB Missile Launcher` - The product string identifies it as the USB Missile Launcher.
5. `usb 1-1: Manufacturer: Syntek` - The manufacturer is identified as Syntek.
6. `hid-generic 0003:2123:1010.0001: device has no listeners, quitting` - This is expected since the device needs a specific driver.

## Changes made to `usb_skeleton.c`

Header and Configuration Changes

Added a new header inclusion: "launcher-commands.h" which contains device-specific constants and commands
Changed device identification:

Replaced generic vendor/product IDs with missile launcher specific IDs
Updated module table to use these missile launcher IDs

Added more detailed module information:

```c
MODULE_LICENSE("GPL");
MODULE_DESCRIPTION("Missile launcher for CPRE488 MP-3");
MODULE_AUTHOR("Eastburn, Ohnesorge");
```

Structure and Naming Changes

### Renamed all primary structures and functions:

- struct usb_skel → struct usb_miss_launch
- All function prefixes: skel_ → miss_launch_
- Driver name: "skeleton" → "missile_launcher"
- Device naming: "skel%d" → "miss_launch%d"

Modified device structure:

- Replaced bulk_in_urb/bulk_out_endpoint with int_in_urb/int_in_endpoint
	- However, this int_in_endpoint was not used in the end since we only needed to send commands to endpoint 0, which is the default control endpoint.
- Removed numerous fields related to bulk transfer processing

### Functional Changes

#### Read functionality

Original had complex logic for reading data via bulk transfers.
New driver simplifies to immediately return 0 (no reads).

#### Write functionality

- Completely redesigned to use control messages instead of bulk transfers
- Added missile launcher specific command formatting:

Uses an 8-byte fixed command buffer (LAUNCHER_CTRL_BUFFER_SIZE)
Sets byte 0 to command prefix (0x2)
Sets byte 1 to the actual command from user
Uses launcher-specific control message parameters

USB communication method:

Original used URBs for bulk data transfer
New driver uses usb_control_msg() with specific parameters:

```c
usb_control_msg(dev->udev,
                usb_sndctrlpipe(dev->udev, 0),
                LAUNCHER_CTRL_REQUEST,
                LAUNCHER_CTRL_REQUEST_TYPE,
                LAUNCHER_CTRL_VALUE,
                LAUNCHER_CTRL_INDEX,
                command_buf,
                command_size,
                1000);
```

#### Endpoint detection

Original looked for bulk-in and bulk-out endpoints
New driver looks for interrupt-in endpoints, even though it is not used. This can be removed!

#### Memory Management

The new driver:

- Uses simple kmalloc instead of usb_alloc_coherent
- Allocates fixed-size buffers for commands
- Explicitly zeroes buffer memory with memset
- Implements proper cleanup with separate flags for memory and semaphore management

Error Handling and Resource Management

Simplified `miss_launch_draw_down()`:

- Original had complex handling for multiple URBs
- New driver simply kills the interrupt URB

Improved exit handling:

Added flags to track resource allocation states
Ensures proper cleanup in all error cases

#### Resource Protection

In both drivers, a semaphore called limit_sem is initialized with WRITES_IN_FLIGHT (set to **8**):
`sema_init(&dev->limit_sem, WRITES_IN_FLIGHT);`

Key Functions of the Semaphore

#### Memory Exhaustion Prevention

By limiting concurrent USB operations, the semaphore prevents excessive memory allocation that could otherwise exhaust system resources, particularly important in kernel space where memory is limited.

##### Flow Control

The semaphore regulates the flow of data from userspace to the USB device, preventing overwhelming the device with too many simultaneous commands.

##### I/O Mode Support

The implementation handles both blocking and non-blocking I/O modes:

In blocking mode: Uses down_interruptible() which may put the process to sleep
In non-blocking mode: Uses down_trylock() which returns immediately if the semaphore can't be acquired

##### Implementation Improvement

The missile launcher driver improves upon the original skeleton driver by adding explicit tracking of semaphore acquisition:
`int sem_downed = 1;  // Flag to track if semaphore was acquired`
And later ensuring proper cleanup:

```c
exit:
    if(sem_downed)
    {
        up(&dev->limit_sem);
    }
```

This prevents potential semaphore leaks in error conditions, which could otherwise lead to deadlocks where subsequent write operations would be permanently blocked after an error occurred.

## Operation of Initial `launcher_fire.c`

The code defines a set of command constants that correspond to different actions the missile launcher can perform, such as:

- LAUNCHER_FIRE (`0x10`): Fires a dart/missile
- LAUNCHER_STOP (`0x20`): Stops all movement
- LAUNCHER_UP (`0x02`), DOWN (`0x01`), LEFT (`0x04`), RIGHT (`0x08`): Directional controls
- Combined directions like UP_LEFT, DOWN_RIGHT, etc.

The program relies on the Linux character device driver properly translating these simple commands into the appropriate USB control messages that the missile launcher hardware can understand.

The main logic is implemented through:

The `launcher_cmd()` function which:

1. Takes a file descriptor and command as input
2. Attempts to write the command to the device file
3. Handles error conditions if the write fails
4. Adds a 5-second delay after firing to allow the launcher to complete its firing sequence

The `main()` function which:

1. Opens the device file `/dev/launcher0` with read/write permissions
2. Sets the command to LAUNCHER_FIRE (this is fixed, not user-controlled)
3. Sends the fire command to the launcher
4. Waits for a specified duration (500ms)
5. Sends the stop command
6. Closes the file descriptor

This particular functionality is quite simple - it just fires the missile launcher once when executed. 

## Algorithm to detect Target

### System Architecture

The system combines computer vision processing with physical hardware control, structured around several key components:

1. **Framebuffer Interface**: The system maps the FPGA's framebuffer memory directly into the application's memory space, providing direct access to the camera feed.

  ```cpp
  // Map framebuffer memory
  fb_mem = mmap(NULL, FB_SIZE, PROT_READ, MAP_SHARED, mem_fd, FB_PHYS_ADDR);
  ```

2. **Launcher Control Interface**: A device driver interface allows the software to command a physical launcher device through simple directional commands.
3. **Computer Vision Processing**: The system uses OpenCV for real-time target detection, combining color-based and shape-based detection methods.
4. **Targeting Logic**: Once targets are detected, the system performs depth estimation and aims the launcher accordingly.

## Target Detection Algorithm
## Sub-Group B's Implementation
**NOTE: Since we could not get Petalinux to work with OpenCV (ran into boot issues), this implementation was not functional on the Zedboard. However, we have ran this implementation on a laptop with its webcam and it works as expected. Refer to sub-group A's implementation for grading as it is functional on the Zedboard.**

The detection algorithm employs a dual-method approach to maximize reliability:

### 1. Color-Based (HSV) Detection

The primary detection method uses HSV color filtering to isolate potential targets based on their color:

```cpp
cv::Point detect_target_hsv(cv::Mat &frame,
                           cv::Mat &debug_frame,
                           DetectionParams &params,
                           bool &detected,
                           float &estimated_z) {
  // Convert the frame from BGR to HSV color space
  cv::Mat hsv_frame;
  cv::cvtColor(frame, hsv_frame, cv::COLOR_BGR2HSV);

  // Create binary masks for the selected color range
  cv::Mat mask1, mask2, mask;
  cv::inRange(hsv_frame, params.primary.lower, params.primary.upper, mask1);

  if (params.useMultiRange) {
    cv::inRange(hsv_frame, params.secondary.lower, params.secondary.upper, mask2);
    cv::bitwise_or(mask1, mask2, mask);
  } else {
    mask = mask1;
  }
  
  // Apply morphological operations to clean up the mask
  // ...
}
```

The algorithm accommodates complex color ranges (like red, which wraps around the hue spectrum) by using multiple threshold ranges when needed.

### 2. Shape-Based Detection

As a fallback, the system also implements shape-based detection using both Hough Circle Transform and contour circularity analysis:

```cpp
// Use Hough Circle Transform to detect circles
std::vector<cv::Vec3f> circles;
cv::HoughCircles(gray, circles, cv::HOUGH_GRADIENT, 1,
                gray.rows / 8, 100, 30, 10, 100);
```

For enhanced reliability, the system also analyzes contour circularity when Hough transform fails:

```cpp
// Circularity = 4π × Area / Perimeter²
// Perfect circle has circularity = 1
double circularity = 4 * M_PI * area / (perimeter * perimeter);

if (circularity > 0.7 && circularity > maxCircularity) {
  maxCircularity = circularity;
  bestContour = i;
}
```

### Depth Estimation

A key feature of this system is the ability to estimate the target's distance from the camera based on its apparent size (knowing the camera's focal length, target diameter, and apparent diameter):

```cpp
float estimate_z_position(double apparent_diameter_pixels) {
  if (apparent_diameter_pixels <= 0) {
    return MAX_TARGET_DISTANCE_CM;
  }

  float estimated_distance = (FOCAL_LENGTH_PIXELS * TARGET_ACTUAL_DIAMETER_CM) / apparent_diameter_pixels;

  if (estimated_distance < MIN_TARGET_DISTANCE_CM) {
    estimated_distance = MIN_TARGET_DISTANCE_CM;
  } else if (estimated_distance > MAX_TARGET_DISTANCE_CM) {
    estimated_distance = MAX_TARGET_DISTANCE_CM;
  }

  return estimated_distance;
}
```

This calculation uses the principle that a target of known physical size (`TARGET_ACTUAL_DIAMETER_CM`) appears smaller in the image as its distance increases.

By knowing the camera's focal length (converted to pixels), we can derive the distance.

### Launcher Control Algorithm

The launcher control system uses a proportional approach to aim at targets:

```cpp
int aim_launcher(int launcher_fd,
                int current_x,
                int current_y,
                int target_x,
                int target_y,
                float target_z) {
  int dx = target_x - current_x;
  int dy = target_y - current_y;
  
  // If target is already centered (within dead zone), we're done
  if (abs(dx) < LAUNCHER_DEAD_ZONE && abs(dy) < LAUNCHER_DEAD_ZONE) {
    // Apply depth-based adjustments
    ret = adjust_aim_for_depth(launcher_fd, target_z);
    return ret;
  }
  
  // Handle horizontal movement first
  // ...
}
```

Notable aspects of the aiming algorithm:

1. It implements a dead zone to prevent jitter when the target is nearly centered
2. It handles horizontal and vertical movements separately
3. Movement duration is proportional to the distance the launcher needs to travel
4. It includes a recursive approach to refine aiming with a limit of 5 attempts
5. It adjusts aim based on target depth to account for projectile ballistics

```cpp
int adjust_aim_for_depth(int launcher_fd, float target_z) {
  // Skip adjustment for close targets
  if (target_z <= 100.0f) {
    return 0;
  }

  // Calculate adjustment time - more adjustment for distant targets
  int adjustment_ms = (int)((target_z - 100.0f) * 0.5f);

  if (adjustment_ms > 0) {
    std::cout << "Depth adjustment: Moving UP for " << adjustment_ms
              << " ms to compensate for distance" << std::endl;
    move_launcher(launcher_fd, LAUNCHER_UP);
    delay_ms(adjustment_ms);
    stop_launcher(launcher_fd);
    return 0;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

### Firing Logic

The system employs a confirmation-based firing mechanism to prevent false positives:

```cpp
if (target_detected) {
  std::cout << "Target detected at position (" << target_point.x
            << ", " << target_point.y << ", " << target_z
            << " cm)" << std::endl;

  consecutive_detections++;

  // Only fire when we have consistent detections to avoid false positives
  if (consecutive_detections >= fire_threshold && fire_cooldown <= 0) {
    // Aim launcher at the target
    ret = aim_launcher(launcher_fd, LAUNCHER_CENTER_X,
                       LAUNCHER_CENTER_Y, target_point.x,
                       target_point.y, target_z);

    if (ret == 0) {
      std::cout << "Target locked, firing!" << std::endl;
      // Fire the launcher
      fire_launcher(launcher_fd);

      // Set cooldown period after firing
      fire_cooldown = 20; // Approx 2 seconds at 100ms loop time
      consecutive_detections = 0;
    }
  }
}
```

Key aspects of the firing logic:

1. It requires multiple consecutive successful detections before firing
2. It implements a cooldown period after firing to prevent rapid repeated firing
3. It only fires after the aiming process has completed successfully

## Configurable Parameters

```cpp
// Target recognition parameters
#define MIN_CONTOUR_AREA 500
#define MAX_CONTOUR_AREA 50000
#define MORPH_KERNEL_SIZE 5

// Launcher control parameters
#define LAUNCHER_MOVE_TIMEOUT_MS 1000

```

## Error Handling

Added error handling helps to manage potential issues with hardware interfaces:

```cpp
mem_fd = open("/dev/mem", O_RDWR | O_SYNC);
if (mem_fd < 0) {
  perror("Failed to open /dev/mem");
  return -1;
}

// Map framebuffer memory
fb_mem = mmap(NULL, FB_SIZE, PROT_READ, MAP_SHARED, mem_fd, FB_PHYS_ADDR);
if (fb_mem == MAP_FAILED) {
  perror("Failed to mmap framebuffer");
  close(mem_fd);
  return -1;
}
```

## Sub-Group A's Implementation
**This is a working implementation**

### Color-based detection:
This approach uses entirely color-based detection to determine the target. It uses preset values to determine the intended target. 
Once detected a target pixel it adds the information to the target variable which holds the center of all pixels found

```cpp
int detect_target(uint16_t (*frame)[1920], Target* target) {
    uint64_t x_sum = 0, y_sum = 0;
    uint32_t count = 0;
    
    // Scan entire frame for target color
    for (int y = 0; y < 1080; y++) {
        for (int x = 0; x < 1728; x += 2) {
            uint16_t pixel1 = frame[y][x];
            uint16_t pixel2 = frame[y][x+1];
            
            // Extract YUV components
            uint8_t y1 = pixel1 & 0xFF;
            uint8_t u = (pixel1 >> 8) & 0xFF;
            uint8_t y2 = pixel2 & 0xFF;
            uint8_t v = (pixel2 >> 8) & 0xFF;
            
            // Detect target color
            if (y1 > TARGET_Y_MIN && y1 < TARGET_Y_MAX && u > TARGET_U_MIN  && u < TARGET_U_MAX && v < TARGET_V_MAX && v > TARGET_V_MIN) {
                x_sum += x;
                y_sum += y;
                count++;
            }
        }
    }

    // Minimum pixel threshold
    if (count > 1000) { 
        target->x = x_sum / count;
        target->y = y_sum / count;
        target->count = count;
        return 1;
    }
    return 0;
}
```
### Preset values:

```cpp
// Detection parameters - edit for a different color(red)
#define TARGET_Y_MIN    38
#define TARGET_Y_MAX    47
#define TARGET_U_MIN    117
#define TARGET_U_MAX    123
#define TARGET_V_MIN    137
#define TARGET_V_MAX    144
```



### Aim and fire
Once a target is detected, the code then moves the camera in line with the target and fires if the center matches the target

```cpp
void aim_and_fire(int fd, Target* target) {
    const uint32_t center_x = 1920 / 2;
    const uint32_t center_y = 1080 / 2;
    
    int x_offset = (int)target->x - (int)center_x;
    int y_offset = (int)target->y - (int)center_y;

    // Movement
    if (x_offset > 50) {
        launcher_cmd(fd, LAUNCHER_RIGHT);
        usleep(abs(x_offset) * 50);
        launcher_cmd(fd, LAUNCHER_STOP);
        //printf("Center: RIGHT");
	}
...
    
    // Fire if centered
    if (abs(x_offset) < 50 && abs(y_offset) < 50) {
        launcher_cmd(fd, LAUNCHER_FIRE);
        usleep(2000000); // Wait for firing to complete
    }

```
